This file demonstrates using PyMata to read temperature values from a SparkFun Digital Temperature Sensor
Breakout for the TMP102 device - SparkFun part #SEN-11931

The code is adapted from the Adafruit backpack library https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-LED-Backpack-Library

It utilizes the bi_color_display_controller which, in turn, utilizes PyFirmata for I2C write control.
